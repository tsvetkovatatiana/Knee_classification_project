### Project Overview
This project was developed for the Image Classification course at my university. The dataset consisted of knee X-ray images in DICOM format, which I preprocessed into PNG format and cropped using regions of interest (ROI).
The main goal of the project was to build a complete pipeline and train an effective image classification model based on the ResNet architecture.
